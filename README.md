# website_parsing_challenge
Website parsing challenge for engineering candidates.

##Goal
The file websites.txt contains a list of 500 websites that have been found by one of our search bots. Your objective is to parse these websites in order to answer the following two questions for each website:
  1. is it an e-commerce website?
  2. does it mention any of the following brands: Gucci, Rolex, Hermès, Dior, Chanel, Louis Vuitton?

Your result should be in tabular format: a tab separated file with the following columns: 
```
website            ecommerce   brands
solidswiss.cd      true        Rolex
stevemccurry.com   false          
```
If you have multiple brands, list them as follows:  ```Gucci, Rolex, Hermès```

Feel free to append to the output file any additional information that you think may be useful, or otherwie make any other enhancement you think off.

You can shoot us any questions via email at: b.suire@data-and-data.com
